# Anthropic SDK Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to update the Anthropic API integration in the AI Chat Web Application to use the official Anthropic TypeScript SDK with CORS support.

## Overview of Changes

The application has been updated to use the official Anthropic TypeScript SDK, which now supports CORS for browser-based applications. This eliminates the need for a proxy server to handle CORS issues.

## Changes Made

1. **Installed the Official SDK**
   - Added the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package to the project dependencies

2. **Updated the Anthropic API Service**
   - Modified `src/api/anthropicApi.ts` to:
     - Import the Anthropic SDK and necessary types
     - Initialize the client with the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` option
     - Update the message formatting to match the SDK's expected format
     - Modify the response handling to extract text from the SDK's response format
     - Improve error handling for various scenarios
     - Update model names to include version dates (e.g., `claude-3-sonnet-20240229` instead of `claude-3-sonnet`)
     - Limit available models to the most reliable ones (Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2, Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
     - Set Claude 3 Haiku as the default model for better reliability and performance
     - Add specific error handling for "Overloaded" errors from the Anthropic API

3. **Deprecated the Proxy Server**
   - Added a deprecation notice to `src/api/anthropicProxy.js`
   - Kept the file for reference purposes only

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `README-anthropic-proxy.md` to reflect the new approach (renamed to Anthropic API Integration)
   - Updated the main `README.md` to reference the updated documentation
   - Updated `README-api-integrations.md` with the new SDK configuration details
   - Created this summary document (`README-anthropic-sdk-update.md`)

## Benefits of the Update

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Eliminated the need for a separate proxy server
2. **Improved Reliability**: Direct API calls using the official SDK are more reliable
3. **Better Type Safety**: The SDK provides TypeScript types for requests and responses
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Using the official SDK means we benefit from updates and improvements
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Developers no longer need to set up and maintain a proxy server

## Security Considerations

While the SDK now supports browser-based requests with the `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` option, it's important to note:

1. **API Key Exposure**: When using this option, the API key is exposed in the browser. This is acceptable for development or personal projects, but for production applications with many users, consider implementing a backend proxy to protect your API key.

2. **Usage Monitoring**: Monitor your API usage to prevent unexpected charges, especially in public-facing applications.
